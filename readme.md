# Random password generator
Just another random password generator with hcaptcha by Anthony M.

Didn't want to do this, but sure, half of the CSS was copy pasted from a good old website of mine (basically it's my website); ah, leavint the generator password aside, avoid copying my CSS and my style, that's more or less my own design, thanks.

## What this does
Generates a random password.

## Time taken to make
Around an hour, just for the design, etc.
Around an hour, just for the javascript part.
Around half an hour, just for the linking and debugging part.
Around 6hours, just to deal with github-actions*.

* may not fully be accurate, I'm taking them from wakatime but github-action is another matter.

Conclusion: You won't learn if you're going to copy paste my stuff, it does take time, but you'll learn.

## Notice
Due to github actions not working with the password generator as intended.. I moved completely to javascript, will do something else with python ig.
